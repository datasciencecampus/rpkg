# rpkg

A simple Dash front end that checks whether the users desired R package name is already a package on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) or [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software). Uses the latest data from each site.  

Front end has been uploaded to [Google Cloud Platform: https://does-r-pkg-name-exist.nw.r.appspot.com/](https://does-r-pkg-name-exist.nw.r.appspot.com/).
